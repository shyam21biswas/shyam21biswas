I thrive on turning ideas into functional, user-friendly apps that make a difference.

What I Do

🤖 Integrating APIs and third-party libraries
🧪 Testing and debugging: Ensuring robust and bug-free apps
🚀 Continuous learning: Staying up-to-date with Android trends and best practices
Projects
Here are some of the cool projects I’ve worked on:
